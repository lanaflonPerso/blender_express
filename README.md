Blender Express
===============

Blender Express is a small project based on [Blender](http://blender.org) and [Blend4Web](http://blend4web.com/).
This project does not follow Blend4Web recommandations for project structure. Hence it is not designed to be integrated in the project management system provided by Blend4Web.

The orginal idea is to show how simple it is to create interactive 3D website.

For Linux (and most surely MacOSX) user, run the script http_file_server.sh to start a lightweight HTTP server based on ncat. Then you can access the demo at http://localhost:8080/blender_express.html
