Blender Express
===============

Blender Express is a small project based on [Blender](http://blender.org) and [Blend4Web](http://blend4web.com/).

* Demo is available [here](http://spoonless.github.io/blender_express/blender_express/index.html)
* Original prototype is available [here](http://spoonless.github.io/blender_express/blender_express_proto/)

This project does not follow Blend4Web recommendations for project structure. Hence it is not designed to be integrated in the project management system provided by Blend4Web.

Running the app locally
-----------------------

For Linux (and most surely MacOSX) user, run the script http_file_server.sh to start a lightweight HTTP server based on ncat. Then you can access the demo at http://localhost:8080/index.html
